### Create and design a personal website**
[cs50_project0](https://github.com/amymhaddad/cs50_project0)

For the course, Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a homepage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. And each page has its own stylesheet.

# Programs and Problems
### Product search in Flask
[flask_product_search](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/flask_product_search)

I pulled JSON data and created a program that takes a product name as input and retrieve the current price and quantity for that product. I returned the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found.

### Product search with user input
[product_search_without_flask](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/product_search)
I pulled JSON data. Then, I created a program that takes a product name, base on user input, to retrieve the current price and quantity for that product. I returned the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found.

### Space with APIs
[space](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/space)
I used the Open Notify API to find out who's in space right now. I Created a program that pulls in this data and displays the information from this API in a tabular format.

### Weather with APIs
[weather](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/weather)
I used the OpenWeatherMap API and created a program that prompts for a city name and returns the current temperature for the city.

### Todo List with user input
[to_do_list](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/to_do)
I created a program that prompts a user to enter a todo. I display the todo's and allow the user to update them. 

### Track personal inventory
[track_inventory](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/track_inventory)
I wrote a program that tracks personal inventory. The program allows the user to enter an item, a serial number, and estimated value. And it prints out the information in a tabular format.
