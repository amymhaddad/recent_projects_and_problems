**Create a web application that centers around a list of books**
[upcase_book_app](https://github.com/amymhaddad/upcase_booklist_app/tree/master/upcase_booklist_app)

Currently this application features a homepage and three additional pages.



**Create and design a personal website**
[cs50_project0](https://github.com/amymhaddad/cs50_project0)

For the course, Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a homepage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. And each page has its own stylesheet.
