A repo that highlights recent projects, programs, and problems.

# Projects
### [Book App](https://github.com/amymhaddad/upcase_booklist_app)

I'm building an application about Python books and authors. It features a homepage and three additional pages: books, authors, and lists pages. A user can navigate among these pages. I plan to apply SQL to this application next. 

### [CS50 Project0](https://github.com/amymhaddad/cs50_project0)

For the course, Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a homepage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. A user can navigate among these pages. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. Each page has its own stylesheet.

# Programs
### [Flask Product Search](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/flask_product_search)
I used Flask to create a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. I retrieved the data from a JSON file. I return the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. 

### [Product Search with User Input](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/product_search)
I created a program that takes a product name as input and retrieves the current price and quantity for that product. The product data is in a data file in the JSON format. The program prints out the product name, price, and quantity if the product is found. If no product matches the search, state that no product was found and start over.

### [Space with API](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/space)
I used the Open Notify API to find out who's in space right now. I created a program that pulls in this data and displays the information in a tabular format.

### [Weather with API](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/weather)
I used the OpenWeatherMap API and created a program that prompts the user for a city name and returns the current temperature for the city.

### [To Do List with User Input](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/to_do)
I created a program that prompts a user to enter a todo. I display the todo's and allow the user to update them. 

### [Track Inventory](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercises_for_programmers_2019/tree/master/track_inventory)
I wrote a program that tracks personal inventory. The program allows the user to enter an item, a serial number, and estimated value. And it prints out the information in a tabular format.

# Problems
### [Luhn](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercism/tree/master/python/luhn)
This is an Exercism problem I completed that determines whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.

### [Armstrong Numbers](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercism/tree/master/python/armstrong-numbers)
This is an Exercism problem I completed that determines whether a number is an Armstrong number, which is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### [Rain Drops](https://github.com/amymhaddad/exercism/tree/master/python/raindrops)
This is an Exercism problem I completed where I had to convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.
